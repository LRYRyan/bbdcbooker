# bbdcbooker
I would like to declare that I do not endorse any form of botting or exploiting. This program is only for personal use and is only applicable to my situation.

Automated program for refreshing BBDC booking page and sending alert when program detects a slot available for booking. To use, enter username and password in line 9 & 10 respectively. Update soundfile.mp3 in line 37 to name of alert mp3 that you have downloaded (personal choice). Make sure the mp3 is in the same folder as code. Start the program and it will automatically navigate to the booking page and begin refreshing every 30 seconds. 
This code allows for you to do something else instead of camping the BBDC website the whole day.
Code is **OUTDATED** and is uploaded here for future reference.
Coded in python, mainly using Selenium library.
Through this project I have gained a deeper understanding of HTML through analysis of the website, as well as the use of web scraping library.
